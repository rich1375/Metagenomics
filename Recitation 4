Go look around the Silva database website:

https://www.arb-silva.de

Find a function or feature that looks useful for your research or general interest.  Briefly summarize the feature and why it looks useful.

The ACT: Alignment, Classification, and Tree service feature could be a useful tool in structuring phylogenetic trees. The website says it could align sequences, search and identify the closest common ancestor to the sequence submitted. This would be really helpful when trying to explain the evolutionary relationships between strains I'm trying to identify in lab. The current drawback from using this is that the feature is limited to ~1000 sequences so theres a chance there would be lots of missing information from the generated tree.

Question 2 (1 point)

Go look around the Greengenes website:

https://rnacentral.org/expert-database/greengenes

Describe a function or feature of interest that is different from what you found on Silva.
Visualizing RNA structues using R2DT. This feature allows you to view or predict RNA structures of interest. The research article linked to the feature states it generates the images by using a library composed of more than 3,000 previously identified RNA structures. From this millions of images have been able to be generated from this feature. The article does state that if an RNA sequence does not have a similar match to one that is already established in the database it cannot generate an image.

Now train a Greengenes dataset so we can add domain/phyla/etc metadata to our samples.  Use the QIIME2 Feature Classifier tutorial (https://docs.qiime2.org/2024.5/tutorials/feature-classifier/) and the runQiime2_taxonomy.sh script on the moving-pictures dataset.  Visualize taxonomy.qzv and click through the report.

What do you notice or find interesting about the report?

I find it intersting that some of the samples that have high confidence are listed as different genus (ie Roseiflexus, Methanopyrus, Nanoarchaeum, Ruminococcus, and Elizabethkingia)

Question 4 (2 points)

We are caught in the middle of QIIME2 and the other databases making a major change to how they post database files.  The source of the controversy is that most scientists would like database files that are easy to transfer, easy to use, and already trained on their data.  This is accuracy, speed, and cost efficiency.  When we built our own classifier above, we used a very small older database that was posted on the QIIME2 website and easy to access.  But we wouldn't use it for a modern study.  In years gone by (even just last year), QIIME2 posted qiime objects that were based on Silva or Greengenes data and ready to use.  This was later found to be security risk and they don't post those anymore.  But the databases are also relocating their sequences, taxonomy, and other info and many of the pages don't link up yet.

So go look around for database files that might be relevant to your alternate dataset or research interests.  Put a link.  It is not required that you run these on your dataset.

Options:
  --type TEXT             The semantic type of the artifact that will be
                          created upon importing. Use `qiime tools list-types`
                          to see what importable semantic types are available
                          in the current deployment.                [required]

                          to decrease in quality. This truncates the 3' end of
                          the of the input sequences, which will be the bases
                          that were sequenced in the last cycles. Reads that
                          are shorter than this value will be discarded. If 0
                          is provided, no truncation or length filtering will
                          be performed                              [required]
  --p-trim-left INTEGER   Position at which sequences should be trimmed due
                          to low quality. This trims the 5' end of the of the
                          input sequences, which will be the bases that were
                          sequenced in the first cycles.          [default: 0]
  --p-max-ee NUMBER       Reads with number of expected errors higher than
                          this value will be discarded.         [default: 2.0]
  --p-trunc-q INTEGER     Reads are truncated at the first instance of a
                          quality score less than or equal to this value. If
                          the resulting read is then shorter than `trunc-len`,
                          it is discarded.                        [default: 2]
  --p-pooling-method TEXT Choices('independent', 'pseudo')
                          The method used to pool samples for denoising.
                          "independent": Samples are denoised independently.
                          "pseudo": The pseudo-pooling method is used to
                          approximate pooling of samples. In short, samples
                          are denoised independently once, ASVs detected in at
                          least 2 samples are recorded, and samples are
                          denoised independently a second time, but this time
                          with prior knowledge of the recorded ASVs and thus
                          higher sensitivity to those ASVs.
                                                      [default: 'independent']
  --p-chimera-method TEXT Choices('consensus', 'none', 'pooled')
                          The method used to remove chimeras. "none": No
                          chimera removal is performed. "pooled": All reads
                          are pooled prior to chimera detection. "consensus":
                          Chimeras are detected in samples individually, and
                          sequences found chimeric in a sufficient fraction of
                          samples are removed.          [default: 'consensus']
  --p-min-fold-parent-over-abundance NUMBER
                          The minimum abundance of potential parents of a
                          sequence being tested as chimeric, expressed as a
                          fold-change versus the abundance of the sequence
                          being tested. Values should be greater than or equal
                          to 1 (i.e. parents should be more abundant than the
                          sequence being tested). This parameter has no effect
                          if chimera-method is "none".          [default: 1.0]
  --p-allow-one-off / --p-no-allow-one-off
                          Bimeras that are one-off from exact are also
                          identified if the `allow-one-off` argument is
                          True.If True, a sequence will be identified as
                          bimera if it is one mismatch or indel away from an
                          exact bimera.                       [default: False]
  --p-n-threads NTHREADS  The number of threads to use for multithreaded
                          processing. If 0 is provided, all available cores
                          will be used.                           [default: 1]
  --p-n-reads-learn INTEGER
                          The number of reads to use when training the error
                          model. Smaller numbers will result in a shorter run
                          time but a less reliable error model.
                                                            [default: 1000000]
  --p-hashed-feature-ids / --p-no-hashed-feature-ids
                          If true, the feature ids in the resulting table
                          will be presented as hashes of the sequences
                          defining each feature. The hash will always be the
                          same for the same sequence so this allows feature
                          tables to be merged across runs of this method. You
                          should only merge tables if the exact same
                          parameters are used for each run.    [default: True]
  --p-retain-all-samples / --p-no-retain-all-samples
                          If True all samples input to dada2 will be retained
                          in the output of dada2, if false samples with zero
                          total frequency are removed from the table.
                                                               [default: True]
Outputs:
  --o-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                          The resulting feature table.              [required]
  --o-representative-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                          The resulting feature sequences. Each feature in
                          the feature table will be represented by exactly one
                          sequence.                                 [required]
  --o-denoising-stats ARTIFACT SampleData[DADA2Stats]
                                                                    [required]

Usage: qiime tools import [OPTIONS]

  Import data to create a new QIIME 2 Artifact. See https://docs.qiime2.org/
  for usage examples and details on the file types and associated semantic
  types that can be imported.

Options:
  --type TEXT             The semantic type of the artifact that will be
                          created upon importing. Use `qiime tools list-types`
                          to see what importable semantic types are available
                          in the current deployment.                [required]
  --input-path PATH       Path to file or directory that should be imported.
                                                                    [required]
  --output-path ARTIFACT  Path where output artifact should be written.
                                                                    [required]
  --input-format TEXT     The format of the data to be imported. If not
                          provided, data must be in the format expected by the
                          semantic type provided via --type. Use `qiime tools
                          list-formats --importable` to see which formats of
                          input data are importable.
  --validate-level [min|max]
                          How much to validate the imported data before
                          creating the artifact. A value of "max" will

Usage: qiime dada2 denoise-single [OPTIONS]

  This method denoises single-end sequences, dereplicates them, and filters
  chimeras.

Inputs:
  --i-demultiplexed-seqs ARTIFACT SampleData[SequencesWithQuality |
    PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]
                          The single-end demultiplexed sequences to be
                          denoised.                                 [required]
Parameters:
  --p-trunc-len INTEGER   Position at which sequences should be truncated due
                          to decrease in quality. This truncates the 3' end of
                          the of the input sequences, which will be the bases
                          that were sequenced in the last cycles. Reads that
                          are shorter than this value will be discarded. If 0
                          is provided, no truncation or length filtering will
                          be performed                              [required]
  --p-trim-left INTEGER   Position at which sequences should be trimmed due
                          to low quality. This trims the 5' end of the of the
                          input sequences, which will be the bases that were
                          sequenced in the first cycles.          [default: 0]
  --p-max-ee NUMBER       Reads with number of expected errors higher than
                          this value will be discarded.         [default: 2.0]
  --p-trunc-q INTEGER     Reads are truncated at the first instance of a
                          quality score less than or equal to this value. If
                          the resulting read is then shorter than `trunc-len`,
                          it is discarded.                        [default: 2]
  --p-pooling-method TEXT Choices('independent', 'pseudo')
                          The method used to pool samples for denoising.
                          "independent": Samples are denoised independently.
                          "pseudo": The pseudo-pooling method is used to
                          approximate pooling of samples. In short, samples
                          are denoised independently once, ASVs detected in at
                          least 2 samples are recorded, and samples are
                          denoised independently a second time, but this time
                          with prior knowledge of the recorded ASVs and thus
                          higher sensitivity to those ASVs.
                                                      [default: 'independent']
  --p-chimera-method TEXT Choices('consensus', 'none', 'pooled')
                          The method used to remove chimeras. "none": No
                          chimera removal is performed. "pooled": All reads
                          are pooled prior to chimera detection. "consensus":
                          Chimeras are detected in samples individually, and
                          sequences found chimeric in a sufficient fraction of
                          samples are removed.          [default: 'consensus']
  --p-min-fold-parent-over-abundance NUMBER
                          The minimum abundance of potential parents of a
                          sequence being tested as chimeric, expressed as a
                          fold-change versus the abundance of the sequence
                          being tested. Values should be greater than or equal
                          to 1 (i.e. parents should be more abundant than the
                          sequence being tested). This parameter has no effect
                          if chimera-method is "none".          [default: 1.0]
  --p-allow-one-off / --p-no-allow-one-off
                          Bimeras that are one-off from exact are also
                          identified if the `allow-one-off` argument is
                          True.If True, a sequence will be identified as
                          bimera if it is one mismatch or indel away from an
                          exact bimera.                       [default: False]
  --p-n-threads NTHREADS  The number of threads to use for multithreaded
                          processing. If 0 is provided, all available cores
                          will be used.                           [default: 1]
  --p-n-reads-learn INTEGER
                          The number of reads to use when training the error
                          model. Smaller numbers will result in a shorter run
                          time but a less reliable error model.
                                                            [default: 1000000]
  --p-hashed-feature-ids / --p-no-hashed-feature-ids
                          If true, the feature ids in the resulting table
                          will be presented as hashes of the sequences
                          defining each feature. The hash will always be the
                          same for the same sequence so this allows feature
                          tables to be merged across runs of this method. You
                          should only merge tables if the exact same
                          parameters are used for each run.    [default: True]
  --p-retain-all-samples / --p-no-retain-all-samples
                          If True all samples input to dada2 will be retained
                          in the output of dada2, if false samples with zero
                          total frequency are removed from the table.
                                                               [default: True]
